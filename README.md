## About the Project

This project is an autonomous balancing system that uses an **MPU 6050 sensor** to measure tilt angles and angular velocity, an **Arduino Mega** microcontroller to process the data, and a **BLDC motor** to achieve balance. The system is controlled using a **PID algorithm**, which ensures stable and precise balancing.

The project was inspired by the need to explore real-world applications of control systems and embedded programming. It serves as a great example of how sensors, microcontrollers, and control algorithms can work together to solve complex problems.
